## Overview
 

## Why do content management systems matter?
 Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). A user-friendly interface for CMS software grants database accessibility with minimal technical knowledge required to use. This ultimately supports inner and cross-team collaboration.
