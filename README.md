## Overview
 This repository is an exhibition of a content management system. The user can consult the repo to learn how to create a command-line application that allows them to manage a company's employee database. The project makes use of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> to work with a back end, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer" target="_blank">Inquirer Package</a> to accept user input when managing the company's database, and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2" target="_blank">MySQL2</a> package to manage the database.



## Why do content management systems matter?
 Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). A user-friendly interface for CMS software grants database accessibility with minimal technical knowledge required to use. This ultimately supports inner and cross-team collaboration.
